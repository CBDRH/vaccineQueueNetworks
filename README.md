# Vaccine Queue Simulator

## About

This applet provides a graphical user interface to the mass vaccination and GP clinic queueing networks estimated with the R package `queuecomputer`. On accessing the applet in a web browser, the results from two default models are presented. These models have been parameterised to reflect the medium-sized baseline model presented here, i.e. the mass vaccination centre with 42 staff members and the GP clinic with eight staff members (see the related [scientific preprint article](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.07.21255067) for more details). The interactive interface allows users to adjust the assumed arrival times, service times and available staff to reflect their own situation or assumptions. Queue performance is summarised in terms of total throughput, processing times and staff utilisation.
