## Welcome to the Vaccine Facility Simulator! 

***

This applet provides a graphical user interface to two mass vaccination queueing networks estimated with the R package [`queuecomputer`](10.18637/jss.v095.i05). Two default queue networks are available: 

**1. A large mass vaccination hub** _entrance &rarr; registration &rarr; assessment &rarr; vaccination &rarr; observation_ 

**2. A small general practice clinic** _registration &rarr; vaccination &rarr; observation_ 

***

### What are the model inputs?

**1. Arrivals** _What is the arrival frequency?_ 

**2. Service times** _How long does each step in the process take?_ 

**3. Number of servers** _How many staff are available at each point in the queue network?_


*** 

### What are the model outputs?

**1. Number of vaccines** _How many vaccinations can be performed in a clinic?_

**2. Processing times** _How long will patients be waiting at each stage?_ 

**3. Staff utilisation** _How busy will the healthcare staff be?_

***

### What questions can I answer with this app?

* How many appoinments should be made available given fixed staffing availablility and clinic opening times? 

* How many staff do we need to vaccinate 1,000 people in an eight-hour clinic? 

* How many vaccinators do we need to keep total waiting times under one hour? 

* How will waiting times be affected if one or more healthcare staff are called away to an emergency?

* How quickly do we need to reconstitute vaccines to keep up with demand?
